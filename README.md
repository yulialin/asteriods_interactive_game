This is a re-make of the well-known Asteriods game. 

With added features:
  * High score board
  * Ship invincibility and “flickering”
  * Adds 1 life for every 10,000 points the player earns
  * Decelerating ship over time (if the forward key isn’t pressed)
  * Randomized shapes of asteroids
Special thanks and credits to my team members: Summer, Nathan and Ziyi !
